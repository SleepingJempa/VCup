Dynamic Programming:
    Combining  some taste of math in programming can efficiently increase  the
    performance. DP  is one  of the  most popular  mathematics and informatics
    methods which is both mathematical optimizations and programming method.

    
Problem Statement:
    Imagine a Snakes and Ladders game which only has one row of cells with  no
    snakes. You  must count the number of  ways we can  reach from the  initial
    cell to the last one.

Input and Rules:
    $n:int $m:int
    $n the number of cells in the only row of the game.
    $m the number of ladders
    [$m lines]
        $s:int $t:int
        This shows the ladder which connect the $s-th cell to the $t-th cell.
        Which means that you will be teleported to $t after you entered $s.
        

Sample:
    Input:
    7 2
    2 4
    3 6
    Output:
