    is  a  magic  character  set  including exact characters  of  the  standard
    alphabet but in random order. You are  given a string of 26 characters  but
    randomized. Suppose  character $c was $i-th character in standard  alphabet
    and $j-th character in the given string, the cost of this character between
    these two alphabet is equal to $(i-j)^2. Similarly for a word containing
    some characters, the cost is equal to sum of the cost of all characters.

    You are given a word in  addition to the  randomized alphabet and your  must
    calculate the cost of the word.


Input and Rules:
    $s:string
    |s| = 26
    $t:string
    |t| < 1000000
