Query and Command
    Command Querying  pattern is  one of the most important  patterns used in a
    various manner like API and CLI Applications.

Problem Statement:
    Given  two  numbers  $n and $q  for the initial number and  the  number  of
    querying must be done on it. Every query is a simple mathematical operation
    that must be done on $n.

Input and Rules:
    $n:int $q:int
    (-100 < n < 100)
    (0 < q < 10)
    [q lines]
    -> $c $t
        if $c is +: add $t to $n
        if $c is -: subtract $t from $n
        if $c is *: multiply $n by $t
        if $c is /: divide $n by $t (floor)
        if $c is %: remainder of $n divided by $t will assign to n
        if $c is ^: $n to the power of $t
        if $c is ?: print the current value of $n on console no need to receive $t
    
Sample:
    Input:
    13 6 
    + 3 
    ?    
    - 13
    ^ 2 
    ?    
    % 5  
    ?    
    !   
    Output:
    16
    9
