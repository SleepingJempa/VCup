Matrix Multiplication:
    Terminal is limited to some rows and columns of characters. Painting on  it
    In science and math, matrices are used in many fields specially in machine-
    -learning and artificial intelligence.

    
Problem Statement:
    Given two  matrices and you  must calculate  the magical multiplication  of
    them. Magical multiplication is like normal multiplication but  instead  of
    multiplying two elements, it use this function:
                $f($x, $y):int => return ($x & $y) + ($x | $y)

Input and Rules:
    $n:int $m:int $k:int
    [n lines][m integers]
    [m lines][k integers]

Sample:
    Input:
    3 2 1
    3 2
    -9 4
    -1 11
    -2
    2
    Output:
    -2
